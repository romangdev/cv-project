A React based CV maker in which users can quickly render their career info into a CV format.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: React.js, HTML, CSS, JS

This CV Maker was made with React.

# Optimizations
If given more time with the project, I'd write many more parameters for a user to fill in on the screen to further flesh out their CV. Additionally, I'd add in functionality to allow users to dyanimically add in and subtract work experience sections. Furthermore, it'd be interesting to allow users to choose from multiple pre-built CV designs, rather than the current default one. 

# Lessons Learned:
This project was some great practice with many of the things I've learned about React. My main focus for this project was on getting comfortable with class based components specifically at first (which I'll eventually rewrite to function based components). I also learned a lot about organizing React projects, and some best practices in regards to passing state attributes around. I had some issues given the lack of a state manager like Redux that I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to overcome. But eventually, I found some slick workarounds that seem obvious now, but weren't initially.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
